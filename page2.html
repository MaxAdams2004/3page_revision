<div class="mainContainer">
<p>Noise-induced hearing loss or NIHL happens when the hairs in a person's inner ear that are responsible for turning mechanical energy into electrical energy for brain activity become damaged. These hairs are auditory sensory receptors. They can become damaged from an extremely loud one time noise or gradually wear down over the course of a long time due to repeated exposure to loud noises like listening to loud music on full volume for years. An example of a one time noise that could lead to NIHL is an explosion. Also, in addition to loud music, a person could develop NIHL if they are constantly exposed to loud noises for work or other activities. People who work on sites with heavy machinery may be at risk.</p>

<p>There are many symptoms for NIHL that can manifest over time or happen all at once, depending on how a person develops NIHL. According to the Cleveland Clinic, some of them are: "A feeling of fullness or pressure in your ear, an inability to hear high-pitched sounds like birds singing, and muffled or distorted speech." These symptoms can last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple days after the encounter with the loud noise has ended. It is also possible for a person may regain their hearing and percieve everything to be normal but still have damage that can continue to accumulate and eventually end in a permanent loss of hearing.</p>
